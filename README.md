# Password Generator Starter Code

First we create a function called 'generatePassword'

now we create the criteria for the password

Let's add all possible values in variables as lists (eg:lower)

We need to prompt for password length (between 8-128 characters) using window.prompt and an if statement

We need to confirm if the password includes lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

Then the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

make sure all prompts are answered

create a random number function

Now create a Loop function

Then password is generated, We need to create a return function
