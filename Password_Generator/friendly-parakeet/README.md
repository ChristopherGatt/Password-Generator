# Password Generator Starter Code

First we create a function called 'generatePassword'

now we create the criteria for the password

We need to prompt for password length (between 8-128 characters)

We need to confirm if the password includes lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

Then the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

make sure all prompts are answered

Then password is generated, We need to create a return function to do this
